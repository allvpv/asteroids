Game for DirectX programming course (2D part). Not very spectacular for sure
but still pretty nice for a game done in 3 days in a very low-level API.

### Remarks for teacher

To create Visual Studio project, please run:

```
cmake . -B build
```

CMake should generate `build\Asteroids.vcxproj` and other files.

I'm sorry for the difficulties, I am using Windows ARM and I have no other
options apart from using CMake.

In case of any difficulties, I am eager to help. Thank you.
